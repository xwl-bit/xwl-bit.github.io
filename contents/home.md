### Research experience
<strong>1. BOBM: An Adaptive Deep Learning Framework for Sepsis Prediction 2025</strong>\
Objective: To address the challenges posed by the complexity and temporal dynamics of sepsis in improving early warning and timely clinical intervention.\
Method: We introduced the Bayes-Optimized Boosting-Mamba Tab Model (BOBM), a novel deep learning-based algorithm that incorporates a bidirectional optimization learning mechanism within an ensemble framework. We designed dynamic agent models to enhance computational efficiency and adaptability across diverse clinical scenarios. Additionally, the model architecture was optimized for different temporal phases to enable more precise estimation of the timing and progression of sepsis risk. To improve interpretability, we implemented SHapley Additive exPlanations value analysis, providing clinicians with actionable insights into potential patterns of sepsis progression.\
Outcome: Experimental evaluation demonstrated that our model attained the highest AUC (0.86-0.95) on the MIMIC-IV dataset across different temporal windows prior to sepsis onset, confirming adaptability and robust generalizability across timeframes. Furthermore, the model demonstrated superior performance AUC( 0.978-0.982) when validated on two independent large-scale external datasets.

<strong>2. Scaling Transformers to High-Dimensional Sparse Data: A Reformer-BERT Approach 2024</strong>\
Objective: To address the challenges of manual cell type annotation in scRNA-seq data, we developed a large-scale pre-trained model for automated cell type classification.\
Method: A novel methodology for cell type classification was developed, leveraging a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) architecture that integrates reformer encoders. This framework was subjected to extensive self-supervised pre-training on substantial scRNA-seq datasets, after which supervised fine-tuning was performed to optimize the model for predictive accuracy on targeted first-tier cell type classification tasks.\
Outcome: The performance of the proposed model was rigorously evaluated through a series of experiments. These evaluations, conducted on scRNA-seq data, consistently revealed the superior efficacy of our approach in accurately classifying major cell categories when compared against several established baseline methods and the inherent difficulties in the field.

<strong>3. MATLAB Tongue Image Processing for Disease Diagnosis 2022 </strong>\
Objective: To overcome the limitations of traditional tongue diagnosis in Chinese medicine, which relies on subjective visual inspection and lacks quantitative accuracy and reproducibility.\
Method: I developed a robust image segmentation pipeline to process histological images with low contrast and complex edges. My method involved converting images to the HSV color space for superior binarization, then applying a sequence of morphological operations (filling, denoising, dilation) to generate precise masks for automated batch segmentation.\
Outcome: Successfully achieved accurate and robust segmentation on two challenging sets of human tongue tissue images, validating the method's effectiveness and practical utility for complex biomedical image analysis.\
Achievement：Gained skills in biomedical image processing, feature engineering, and supervised learning.

<strong>4. Machine Learning-Assisted Image Biosensor for Cystitis Diagnosis 2024 </strong>\
Objective: To address the limitations of inaccurate and subjective manual analysis.\
Method:I played a key interdisciplinary role by fabricating PEI-modified slides for enhanced cfDNA capture and acquiring fluorescence microscopy images. I then participated in training machine learning models to classify disease states by analyzing quantitative features of the cfDNA spot patterns (e.g., size, intensity). \
Outcome:Our integrated biosensor achieved 94.4% diagnostic accuracy, establishing a rapid and quantitative strategy that overcomes the low specificity and long turnaround time of traditional diagnostic methods.\
Achievement：Delivered a reproducible workflow integrating deep learning detection with wet‑lab cfDNA capture for potential early cystitis diagnosis.

<strong>5. Surfactant-Modified Muco-Penetrating Nanomaterials 2022 </strong>\
Method:My role involved experiment and data analysis in the multi-step synthesis of muco-penetrating nanoparticles. I contributed to the surface modification of silica cores with stearic acid and zwitterionic surfactants (DLPC) and was responsible for processing the resulting characterization and performance data.\
Outcome: Successfully created nanoparticles with enhanced mucus penetration (32.1% higher Papp), demonstrating a viable strategy for oral drug delivery.\
Achievement：Performed UPLC-MS/MS analysis, nanoparticle characterization (TEM, DLS), and in-vitro validatio.
